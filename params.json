In addition, you must have a tc4-shield, programmed with the latest \"bourbon\" arduino code from \r\nhttp://code.google.com/p/tc4-shield/downloads/list\r\nTC4-StdLib-REL-300.zip & aBourbon-REL-300.zip\r\n\r\nOnce you have the tc4 attached, you must set the app.config with the following settings - \r\ngmail_email, gmail_password, com_port\r\ncom_port is required.  If you want alarms to work, the gmail settings are required.\r\n\r\nOn start, it should send you an email letting you know that it's begun, and sending you the mobile link.  You can use this to view the graph and alarms on your phone.\r\n\r\n\r\n","tagline":"Temp Monitor using tc4-shield","google":"","note":"Don't delete this file!
